# Screenshot Essays

This Obsidian plugin can easily help you export any article as a screenshot essay. The plugin allows you to convert even your lengthy blog posts into multiple screenshot images that can be easily shared on Instagram, Twitter or Linkedin as carousels, stories or as handy images for your tweets.


## Special Thanks

- [dom-to-image](https://github.com/tsayen/dom-to-image) & [dom-to-image-more](https://github.com/1904labs/dom-to-image-more). This repo borrows lots of code from [dom-to-image-more](https://github.com/1904labs/dom-to-image-more). The amazing lib helps me generate images from dom.
- Special thanks to [zhou hua and his plugin](https://github.com/zhouhua/obsidian-export-image) from which I've forked this plugin.
